# storyline

**[WIP] This mod is still just a rough draft, and is nowhere close to being functional**

`storyline` is a modding API which allows games to add a simple linear storyline.
The mod works by considering a storyline to be made out of simple building blocks
called "events", which are connected to each other in a linear fashion.

(More details will follow...)
